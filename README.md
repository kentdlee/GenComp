# GenComp
GenComp is a compiler generator illustrating many of the concepts of regular expressions, NFAs, DFAs, Grammars, LALR(1) parser construction, and push-down automata.

The programs here provide solutions for materials that I provide students when working on homework problems. The website 

http://cs.luther.edu/~leekent/ComputationalModels 

provides the student version of code with some exercises for them to do. 

The website and these materials are used in conjunction with teaching from the text "Formal Languages and Automata" Fifth Edition by Peter Linz that I use in teaching a course on Computational Models.
